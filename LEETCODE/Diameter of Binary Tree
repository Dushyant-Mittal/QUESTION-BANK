Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between 
class Solution {
public:
    int x=0;
    int height(TreeNode* root){
        if(!root){
            return 0;
        }
        int left=height(root->left);
        int right=height(root->right);
        int y = left+right;
        x = max(x,y);
        return max(left,right)+1;
    }
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        height(root);
        return x;
    }
};
