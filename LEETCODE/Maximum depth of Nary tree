Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

 class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(Node* root) {
        if(root==NULL){
            return 0;
        }
        int ans=0;
        for(auto it:root->children){
            ans=max(ans,maxDepth(it));
        }
        return ans+1; 
    }
};
