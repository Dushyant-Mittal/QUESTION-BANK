 There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

 class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int consumedBottles = 0;

        while (numBottles >= numExchange) {
            // Consume numExchange full bottles.
            consumedBottles += numExchange;
            numBottles -= numExchange;

            // Exchange them for one full bottle.
            numBottles++;
        }

        // Consume the remaining numBottles (<numExchange).
        return consumedBottles + numBottles;
    }
};
