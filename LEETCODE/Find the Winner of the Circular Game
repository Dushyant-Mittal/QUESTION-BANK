There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.

class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        queue<int>q;
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            q.push(i);
        }
        while(q.size()>1){
            for(int i=1;i<k;i++){
                auto x=q.front();
                q.pop();
                q.push(x);
            }
            q.pop();
        }
        return q.front();
    }
};
