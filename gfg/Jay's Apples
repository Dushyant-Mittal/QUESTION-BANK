Given a queue of persons represented by an array of integers, where each person is identified by a specific integer, find the minimum kilograms of apples that need to be distributed, ensuring that each person receives 1 kilogram of apples only once.
int minimum_apple(int arr[], int n){
    // Complete the function
    set<int>st;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        st.insert(arr[i]);
    }
    return st.size();
}
