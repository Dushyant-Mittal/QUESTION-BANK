 The two countries of A and B are at war against each other. The power of these soldiers is given by arr1[i] of A and arr2[i] of B. They can only attack their counterpart enemies like arr1[i] can attack only arr2[i] and not anyone else. Both countries have equal number of counterparts. A soldier with a higher power can kill the enemy soldier. If both soldiers have the same power, they both die. You need to find the winning country.
