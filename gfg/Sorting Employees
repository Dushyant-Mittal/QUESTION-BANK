You are given two arrays, employee and salary, where employee[i] denotes the name of the ith employee, and salary[i] denotes the salary of the ith employee. Your task is to sort the employee array based on their salaries in non-decreasing order. If two or more employees have the same salary, sort them alphabetically by their names. Return the sorted employee array
class Solution{
	public:
	static bool comp(node& a, node& b){
        if(a.salary==b.salary){
            return a.name<b.name;
        }
        else{
            return a.salary<b.salary;
        }
    }
    void sortRecords(node arr[], int n){
        // Your code goes here
        sort(arr,arr+n,comp);
    }
};
