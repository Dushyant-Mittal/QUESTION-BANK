You are given a binary array arr[], where each element is either 0 or 1. Your task is to rearrange the array in increasing order in place (without using extra space). You do not need to return anything; simply modify the input array.

class Solution{
  public:
    void binSort(int A[], int N){
        sort(A,A+N);
    }
};
