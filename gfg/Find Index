Given an unsorted array arr[] of integers and a key which is present in this array.
You need to write a program to find the start index( index where the element is first
found from left in the array ) and end index( index where the element is first found
from right in the array ) return an array of length 2 with elements start index and 
end index.(0 based indexing is used)
If the key does not exist in the array then return -1 for both start and end index in this case.

class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> findIndex(vector<int>& arr, int key) {
        // code here.
        int n=arr.size();
        int x=0, y=n-1;
        while(x<=y){
            if(arr[x]!=key){
                x++;
            }
            else if(arr[y]!=key){
                y--;
            }
            else{
                return {x,y};
            }
        }
        return {-1,-1};
    }
};
