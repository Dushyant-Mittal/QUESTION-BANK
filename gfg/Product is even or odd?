You are given two long numbers N1 and N2 in a string. You need to find out if the product of these numbers generate an even number or an odd number, If it is an even number print 1 else print 0.


int EvenOdd(string n1 , string n2)
{
    //code here.
    int x=n1.size();
    int y=n2.size();
    if((n1[x-1]*n2[y-1])%2==0){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
