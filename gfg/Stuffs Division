You are given an array arr[] where each element represents the amount of goodies currently held by students. Each student at index i should receive exactly i amount of goodies (1-based indexing) for a fair distribution, with no wastage allowed. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to redistribute the goodies such that the student at index i gets exactly i amount of goodies. Return true if it is possible otherwise return false.
class Solution{
  public:
    bool possible(long long arr[], long long n){
        //code here.
        int c=0;
        int ans=n*(n+1)/2;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            c+=arr[i];
        }
        if(c==ans){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
    }
};
