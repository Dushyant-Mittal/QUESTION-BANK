 The RPS world championship is here. Here two players A and B play the game. You need to determine who wins.
Both players can choose moves from the set {R,P,S}.
The game is a draw if both players choose the same item.
The winning rules of RPS are given below:

 class Solution{
  public:
    string gameResult (string s){
        //code here.
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            if(s[0]==s[1]){
                return"DRAW";
            }
            else if(s[0]=='R' && s[1]=='S'|| s[0]=='P' && 
                    s[1]=='R'|| s[0]=='S' && s[1]=='P'){
                return "A";
            }
            else{
                return "B";
