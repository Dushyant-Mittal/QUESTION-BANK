Create two classes:

Cuboid
The Cuboid class should have three data fields- length, width and height of int types. The class should have display() method, to print the length, width and height of the cuboid separated by space.

CuboidVol 
The CuboidVol class is derived from Cuboid class, i.e., it is the sub-class of Cuboid class. The class should have read_input() method, to read the values of length, width and height of the Cuboid. The CuboidVol class should also overload the display() method to print the volume of the Cuboid ( length * width * height ).

//User function Template for C++

class Cuboid 
{
   //Add your code here.
   public:
   float l, w, h;
   void display(){
      cout<<l<<" "<<w<<" "<<h<<endl; 
   }
};

class CuboidVol: public Cuboid
{
    //Add your code here.
    public:
    void read_input(float l, float w, float h){
      this->l=l;
      this->w=w;
      this->h=h;
    }
    void display(){
        cout<<(h*w*l)<<endl;
    }
};
