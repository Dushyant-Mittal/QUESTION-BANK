Complete the function relationalOperators() that compares two integers a and b. Print:

"a is greater than b" if a is greater than b
"a is less than b" if a is less than b
"a is equal to b" if a equals b
Each output should be followed by a newline character.

public:
    void relationalOperators(int A,int B){
        // code here
        if(A>B){
            cout<<A<<" is greater than "<<B<<endl;
        }else if(A<B){
            cout<<A<<" is less than "<<B<<endl;
        }else {
            cout<<A<<" equal to "<<B<<endl;
