Given a Binary Tree of size n, You have to count leaves in it. For example, there are two leaves in the following tree

        1
      /   \
    10     39
   /
  5

class Solution{
  public:
    int countLeaves(Node* root){
        // write code here
        if(root==NULL){
            return 0;
        }
        if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL){
            return 1;
        }
        return countLeaves(root->left)+countLeaves(root->right);
    }
};
