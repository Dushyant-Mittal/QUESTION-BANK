Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the
linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the
linked list.

class Solution{
  public:
    int getCount(struct Node* head){
        // Code here
        int count=0;
        while (head!=nullptr){
            count++;
            head=head->next;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
