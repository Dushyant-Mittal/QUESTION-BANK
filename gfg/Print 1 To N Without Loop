Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops.
You only need to complete the function printNos() that
takes n as a parameter and prints the number from 1 to n recursively.

class Solution{
    public:
    //Complete this function
    void printNos(int N)
    {
        //Your code here
        if(N>=1) 
        {
            printNos(N-1);
            cout<< N <<" ";
        }
    }
};
