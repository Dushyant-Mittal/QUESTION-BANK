Given a string S which consists of alphabets , numbers and special characters. You need to write a program to split the strings in three different strings S1, S2 and S3 such that the string S1 will contain all the alphabets present in S , the string S2 will contain all the numbers present in S and S3 will contain all special characters present in S.  The strings S1, S2 and S3 should have characters in same order as they appear in input.

class Solution{   
public:
    vector<string> splitString(string S){ 
        // code here 
        string S1;
        string S2;
        string S3;
        vector<string> ans;
        for(int i=0; i<S.length(); i++){
            if(S[i]>='A' && S[i]<='Z' || S[i]>='a' && S[i]<='z'){
                S1+=S[i];
            }
            else if(S[i]>='0' && S[i]<='9'){
                S2+=S[i];
            }
            else{
                S3+=S[i];
            }
        }
        ans.push_back(S1);
        ans.push_back(S2);
        ans.push_back(S3);
        return ans;
    } 
};
