Let's begin your journey towards coding with the very first question of the coding world. Your task is to write code that prints Hello World.


class Solution{
    public:
    void helloWorld()
    {
        //Type below cout<<"Hello World"; 
        //cout will output to console
        cout<<"Hello World"; 
    }
};
