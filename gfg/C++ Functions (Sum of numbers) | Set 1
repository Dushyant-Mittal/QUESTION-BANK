Given three numbers A, B, C you have to write a function named 
calcSum() which takes these 3 numbers as arguments and returns their 
sum.



/*  Write your function here */

/* The function should be named calcSum
    and accepts three parameters of integer type
    and returns the sum of the three integers */
    
int calcSum(int a, int b, int c)    
{
    // Your code here
    return a+b+c;
}
