Given an array arr[] where no two adjacent elements are same, find the index of a peak element. An element is considered to be a peak if it is greater than its adjacent elements (if they exist). If there are multiple peak elements, return index of any one of them. The output will be "true" if the index returned by your function is correct; otherwise, it will be "false".

Note: Consider the element before the first element and the element after the last element to be negative infinity.

/* The function should return the index of any
   peak element present in the array */

// arr: input array
// n: size of array
class Solution
{
    public:
    int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
    {
        int l=0, r=n-1;
        while(l<r){
            int mid=l+(r-l)/2;
            if(arr[mid]>arr[mid + 1]){
                r=mid;
            } 
            else{
                l=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
};
