Chunky gets happy by eating Melody. Given an array arr[], each element represents the happiness Chunky gets by eating the melody.
Chunky knows why Melody is so chocolaty but will only tell you once you tell him the maximum happiness he can get by eating two adjacent melodies.


int max_adjacent_sum(int arr[], int n){
    // Complete the function
    vector<int>v;
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
        sum = arr[i] + arr[i+1];
        v.push_back(sum);
    }
    int ans = *max_element(v.begin(),v.end());
    return ans;
}
