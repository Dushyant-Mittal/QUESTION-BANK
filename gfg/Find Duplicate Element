 Given a sorted array arr[] having 10 elements which contain 6 different numbers in which only 1 number is repeated five times. Your task is to find the duplicate number using two comparisons only.
int findDuplicate(int A[]){
    // Your code goes here
    int i=0;
    while(A){
        if(A[i]==A[i+1]){
            return A[i];
            break;
        }
        i++;
    }
}
