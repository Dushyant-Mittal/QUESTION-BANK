Numbers have a measure of friendliness defined as the absolute difference between them. Given an circular array of integers arr[], calculate the friendliness of the array. Friendliness is the sum of the absolute differences between each element and its closest friend in the array.
class Solution{
  public:
    int sumOfMinAbsDifferences(int arr[], int n){ 
        //code here.
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        int sum=0;
        sum+=(arr[1]-arr[0]);
        for(int i=1;i<n-1;i++){
            int a=arr[i]-arr[i-1];
            int b=arr[i+1]-arr[i];
            int x=min(a,b);
            sum+=x;
        }
        sum+=(arr[n-1]-arr[n-2]);
        return sum;
    }
};
