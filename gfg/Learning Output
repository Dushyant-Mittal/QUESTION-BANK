 Being a Programmer you have to learn how to make your output looks better. According to the company, its company programmers have to present its output in a different manner as: If your output is 10.000000 you can save the decimal places and thus your output becomes 10. Now u have the learn the way to output.  You are given elements of an array A[N] and you have to divide N by total no. of +ve integers, N by total no. of -ve integers, and N by total no. of zero value integers.

 class Solution{
    public:
    void Learning(int a[], int n, float &pos, float &neg, float &zero ){
        // Your code goes here
        int P=0, N=0, Z=0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            if(a[i]>0){
                P++;
            }
            else if(a[i]<0){
                N++;
            }
            else{
                Z++;
            }
        }
        pos=n*1.0/P;
        neg=n*1.0/N;
        zero=n*1.0/Z;
    }
};
