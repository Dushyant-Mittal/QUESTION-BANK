A and B are good friends and programmers. They decide to judge the best among them by competing. They do so by comparing their three skills as per their values.

Skills of A are arr1= [a1, a2, a3]
Skills of B are arr2= [b1, b2, b3]

Compare ith skill of A with ith skill of B whichever has a higher skill value gets 1 point

class Solution{
    public:
    void scores(long long a[], long long b[], int &ca, int &cb)
    {
        // Your code goes here   
        for(int i=0; i<3; i++){
            if(a[i]<b[i]){
                cb++;
            }
            else if(b[i]<a[i]){
                ca++;
            }
        } 
    }
};
