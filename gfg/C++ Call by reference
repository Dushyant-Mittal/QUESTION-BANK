Rahul loves to play with numbers, he challenges his friend Ankush with a problem related to numbers in which he has to first reverse the order of two digits and then swap them. Let us take the two digits as a and b.

void reverse_dig(int &a,int &b){
    int c=0,d=0,f=10;
    while(a){
        c=c*f+a%10;
        a/=10;
    }
    a=c;
    while(b){
        d=d*10+b%10;
        b/=10;
    }
    b=d;
}
void swap(int &a,int &b){
    int temp=a;
    a=b;
    b=temp;
}
