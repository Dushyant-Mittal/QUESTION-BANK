Iterators are used to iterate over vectors, maps, sets etc. Here we will learn to iterate over a vector from begin to end.
You are given a  vector v and iterators it1 and it2 that points to the begining and end of the vector respectively. You need to print its elements.


//User function Template for C++

//Complete this function. it1 points to vector.begin(), it2 points to vector.end()
void iter(vector<int>::iterator it1,vector<int>::iterator it2)
{
    //Your code here. Use iterator to print all the elements
    for(auto it=it1; it!=it2; it++){
        cout<<*it<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
}
