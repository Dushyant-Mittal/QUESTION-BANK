Given length l, width b and height h of a cuboid. Your task is to return an array containing the total surface area and volume of the cuboid.


class Solution{
	public:
	vector<long long int> find(int l, int b, int h)
	{
	    // Code here
	    vector<long long int>v;
        v.push_back((long long) 2*((long long)l*b+(long long)b*h+(long long)l*h));
        v.push_back((long long)l*b*h);
        return v;
	}  
};
